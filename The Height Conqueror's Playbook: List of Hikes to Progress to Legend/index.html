    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Ascent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, vertical scrolling application designed as a narrative journey. The core is a central "Playbook Path" that users scroll through, visually representing the progression through the 10 peaks. Clicking a peak opens a detailed modal view with tabbed content (Story, Guide), keeping the user in the main flow. This structure was chosen because it directly mirrors the concept of a progressive journey, making the experience more intuitive and story-driven than a static grid or dashboard. It allows users to consume the information sequentially, as intended by the playbook, or jump to specific points of interest. An interactive comparison chart is included to provide an alternative, data-driven view. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The 10-peak progression is visualized as an HTML/Tailwind vertical timeline to represent the journey. Peak comparison stats (Fear Factor, etc.) are shown in an interactive Chart.js bar chart to allow for dynamic analysis. Individual peak details are organized in a modal with tabs to handle the rich narrative and practical content without cluttering the main view. A custom "Fear Factor" rating is visualized using Unicode icons for thematic flair. This design uses Chart.js for canvas-based charts and structured HTML/CSS for all other visual elements, adhering to the NO SVG/Mermaid requirement, to create a cohesive and interactive narrative experience. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

The "Playbook" is my roadmap from gentle trails to heart-pounding ridges, designed to gradually build the confidence and skills needed to stand tall on any summit. This site documents every step of that journey—the challenges, the triumphs, and the lessons learned—to inspire anyone looking to conquer their own mountains, literal or metaphorical.

                This project was born from a simple but powerful goal: to no longer be held back by a fear of heights. My name is [Your Name], and I created this playbook as my own personal therapy and training plan. I believe in the transformative power of the outdoors and in facing challenges head-on. My hope is that by sharing this journey, I can connect with others, build a supportive community, and encourage you to start your own playbook.
