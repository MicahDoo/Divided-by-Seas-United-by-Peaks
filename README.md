* This is a passion project of mine to track and reflect on my relationship with heights, recording my past struggles and achievments (from debilitating fear of heights to conquering the legendary Stegosaurus Ridge) and hopefulling paving a way for future endeavors (multi-day expeditions in Europe, Japan, New Zealand, etc.)
