# Divided by Seas, United by Peaks: My Hiking and Mountaineering Journey
* [Link to the website](https://micahdoo.github.io/Divided-by-Seas-United-by-Peaks/)
* This is a passion project of mine to track and reflect on my relationship with heights, recording my past struggles and achievements (from debilitating fear of heights to conquering the legendary Stegosaurus Ridge) and hopefully paving a way for future endeavors (multi-day expeditions in Europe, Japan, New Zealand, etc.)
